hiii :D

this is the insgructions for the windows executor (incase you're an idiot)

i feel like everything will go well except for a few things

1. this codes in c#, however you're only defining a function or wahtever, just write MessageBox.Show("skibidi"); to know what im saying, you cant write shit like private void Skibid() only in a single whatever
2. how'd you even find this
3. the text box is defined as textBoxInput, use it like "string input = textBoxInput;"
4. when it creates AutoExec as a folder, if you put in a .txt file containing some code, (ex. MessageBox.Show("AutoExec Testing");) it will automatically execute upon injection
5. it injects for a closer feeling to an actual roblox executor
6. haha barrel i made auto execute!!!
